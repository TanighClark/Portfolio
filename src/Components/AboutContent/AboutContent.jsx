        <h1>&lt;About ME/&gt;</h1>
            <p>I hold an Associate's degree in Liberal Arts, another 
                in Information Technology & Networking, and a Programming 
                Essentials certificate. These qualifications equip me with 
                the skills and knowledge to pursue a career in Technology. 
                By 2025, I will have completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer 
                Information Systems, focusing on Software Programming.</p>
            <p>During my free time, I enjoy crafting websites. Along my learning path, 
                I discovered a passion for web developmentâ€”I find myself completely 
                immersed, often losing track of time while designing and learning on 
                the go. There's something fulfilling about transforming a blank white 
                screen into a beautiful and organized interface.</p>
